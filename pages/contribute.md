# Contribute to the Blanket

## Who can contribute?

Anyone can contribute, there is no need to have prior crochet experience.

TekhnÄ“-cal Village is home to the blanket; there will be instructions available there for self-guided crochet and knitting. Feel free to ask anyone you see there for help!

If the typical crochet/knitting techniques are difficult for you, ask a villager for help. We can offer advice, adaptive tools, and alternative techniques, such as:
  * different ways to tension your yarn or hold your hook/needles
  * thick foam handles to make holding a crochet hook easier
  * knitting looms
  * finger knitting

## How do I add to the blanket?

### Create a contribution

Each contribution to the blanket should be a 15cm x 15cm (6in x 6in) crochet or knit* square. Try to get as close to 15cm as possible without going over - dimensions between 14cm and 15.5cm will be accepted. It is better for the square to be slightly too small than slightly too big.

The design and colour(s) of the square are up to you! It can be as simple or as complicated as you like, as long as it fits the dimensions. Check out [Patterns](patterns.md) for inspiration, or search the internet for more ideas.

You should use a yarn between DK (4mm) and chunky (6mm) weight. Any fibre is acceptable. The village will have a stash of DK and chunky yarn that anyone can use.

\* <small>other forms of crafted square may be accepted as long as they can be sewn into the blanket with a [blunt tapestry needle](https://stitchedmodern.com/collections/tools-notions/products/plastic-tapestry-needle?variant=31337407676529)!</small>

### Add your contribution to the blanket

Find Eli (the blanket's owner) and let them know about your contribution, so it can be catalogued along with your name (optional) and any notes you'd like to add about it (e.g. why you chose your design, or what the colours represent). Eli will show you where and how to join your square to the blanket.

You can also send in squares by EMF internal post and someone will sew them them for you - please include a note for the catalogue!

#### Advance contributions

You are welcome to make a contribution (or contributions) ahead of EMF and bring it to the village after you arrive. If you can't make it to EMF, you can post squares to Eli - ask Eli directly for his address.

### Share it online!

Feel free to share pictures of your contribution and/or the whole blanket online and encourage others to visit the village!
