## Stitch references

If you've never crocheted before, there are more robust learning resources available in [TekhnÄ“-cal Village](https://wiki.emfcamp.org/2024/wiki/Tekhn%C4%93-cal_Village) and on YouTube (search 'learn to crochet').

If you just need a reminder of how to form the basic stitches, see [Stitch Reference](stitch_reference.md).
