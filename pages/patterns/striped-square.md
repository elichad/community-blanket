# Striped Square

**Level:** Beginner

**Yarn weight:** Chunky (6.0mm hook) or [adapt for DK yarn (4.0mm hook)](#adapt-for-dk-yarn-40mm-hook)

**Source**: Eli

## Pattern

**Stitch Key:**
* ch: chain stitch
* dc: double crochet
* st: stitch (any)

**Foundation chain.** Work approximately 17 ch - adjust the exact number so you have a chain between 12-13 cm long. Ch 2 more.
**Row 1.** 1 dc into the third ch from the hook, *dc into next st, repeat from * to end of row, turn. The length of the work should have grown to around 14-15 cm - if it is significantly over or under, undo the row and adjust the number of stitches in the foundation chain, then try again.
**Row 2.** 2 ch, *dc into next st, repeat from * to end of row, turn.
**Rows 3-end.** Repeat row 2 until the height of the work is 14-15 cm. You can expect to have approximately 9 rows.
**Finishing** Fasten off and weave in ends.

**Modifications**
* Incorporate one or more rows of single crochet or treble crochet to create a slightly different texture. Single crochet is especially useful for getting the square to be the right height.
* Change colour at the end of a row to create a stripe. To create equal-width stripes, change after a consistent and ideally even number of rows (e.g. every 4 rows). This pattern is great for making pride flags and country flags!

## Adapt for DK yarn (4.0mm hook)

The pattern is exactly the same, but your stitches will be smaller and so it will take longer to make a square of the same size. Your foundation chain will be approximately 23 stitches (still 12-13 cm long), and you will work approximately 13 rows (still 14-15cm high).
