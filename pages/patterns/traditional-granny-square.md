## Pattern

This pattern uses [US stitch terminology](https://easycrochet.com/uk-to-us-crochet-terms/) (the same as the EMF workshop teaches).

**Stitch Key:**
* ch: chain stitch
* ss: slip stitch
* dc: double crochet
* st: stitch (any)

**Foundation ring.** Work 4 ch and join with a ss to the first ch, forming a ring.

**Round 1.** Work 3 ch, then 2 dc in the ring, then 3 more ch; *then 3 dc in the ring and 3 ch. Repeat from * 2 more times. Join the round with a ss to the top of the first chain. Fasten off and optionally change colour.

**Round 2.** Join new yarn in any 3-ch space. Ch 3, work 2 dc, ch 3, work 3 dc in that same space. *Ch 1, work 3 dc, ch 3, work 3 dc all in the next 3-ch space. Repeat from * 2 more times. Ch 1, then join the round with a ss to the top of the first chain. Fasten off and optionally change colour.

**Round 3.** Join new yarn in any 3-ch space. Ch 3, work 2 dc, ch 3, work 3 dc in that same space. Ch 1, work 3 dc in the next 1-ch space. *Ch 1, work 3 dc, ch 3, work 3 dc all in the next 3-ch space for the corner. Ch 1, work 3 dc in the next 1-ch space. Repeat from * 2 more times. Ch 1, then join the round with a ss to the top of the first chain. Fasten off and optionally change colour. Check if you are at the necessary size yet, and stop if you are.

**Round 4.** Join new yarn in any 3-ch space. Ch 3, work 2 dc, ch 3, work 3 dc in that same space. (Ch 1, work 3 dc in the next 1-ch space) twice. *Ch 1, work 3 dc, ch 3, work 3 dc all in the next 3-ch space for the corner. (Ch 1, work 3 dc in the next 1-ch space) twice. Repeat from * 2 more times. Ch 1, then join the round with a ss to the top of the first chain. Fasten off.

**Finishing** Weave in all ends.

## Adapt for DK yarn (4.0mm hook)

The pattern is the same, but your stitches will be smaller and so you will need more rounds to make a square of the same size. After round 4, hopefully you have the hang of the repeating pattern you need to make and how it grows with each round - continue making rounds in the same way until you reach the required size.
