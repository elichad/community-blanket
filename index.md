## Location

The blanket lives in [TekhnÄ“-cal Village](https://wiki.emfcamp.org/2024/wiki/Tekhn%C4%93-cal_Village) (northwest of Stage A, [see on map](https://map.emfcamp.org/#17/52.040506/-2.378641)). There's space and yarn to make contributions there!

**If you're dropping off squares, please make time to sew them into the blanket** - see the [instructions](pages/contribute.md#add-your-contribution-to-the-blanket).
